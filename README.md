# YK2-Switch-Buttons-Modified
https://www.nexusmods.com/yakuzakiwami2/mods/567 but I swapped A/B and X/Y back to their original places

All credit goes to **geefour** for the mod, I just swapped the buttons back because I use a [Wii U Pro Controller with an XInput wrapper](https://github.com/KeyPuncher/WiinUPro).
